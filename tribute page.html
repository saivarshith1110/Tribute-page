         <h3S>Steven Paul Jobs[1] (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American business magnate,
             inventor, and investor. He was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple; the chairman and majority 
             shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition
             of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. He was a pioneer of the personal computer
             revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

             Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American mother.
             He was adopted shortly after his birth. Jobs attended Reed College in 1972
             before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India seeking
             enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded
             Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo
             gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II,
             one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the 
             commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had 
             a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful 
             Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first 
             mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing 
             industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer 
             to feature vector graphics.
            
             Apple cofounder Steve Jobs finally succumbed to cancer at the age of 56 on October
             5th, leaving behind a legacy that changed the computer, music, film and wireless
             industries. His once written-off tech company in August briefly topped ExxonMobil 
             as the most valuable U.S. corporation. In that month he resigned as CEO. The
             Reed College dropout founded Apple in his garage. Jobs created the Macintosh 
             in 1976 and was fired 9 years later after a power struggle with Chief
             Exec John Sculley. He returned to Apple in 1996. At the time of his death most
             of his wealth still came from Disney, due to Disney's purchase of Pixar in 
             2006; as the largest individual shareholder, he owned about $4.47 billion of
             Disney stock.</h3>
